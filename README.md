# RichTorchDLL.jl

Small utilities to combine RICH and TORCH DLL scores for particle identification
and to evaluate PID performance.

## Quick start (Julia project)

All commands assume you are in the repository root. Use a Julia project environment so
the correct dependencies from `Project.toml` / `Manifest.toml` are used.

1. Start Julia with the project activated:

```bash
julia --project=.
```

2. From the Julia REPL instantiate the environment (install packages):

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.instantiate()
```
